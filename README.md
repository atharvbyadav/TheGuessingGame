## 🚀 Features

- **Personalized Experience**:
  - Enter your name at the start of the game for a customized gameplay experience.
  - Start with a customizable balance to play the game.

- **Dynamic Betting**:
  - Place a bet based on your available balance for each round.
  - Win **10x your bet** if you guess the correct number.

- **Randomized Outcomes**:
  - Every round features a random dice roll between 1 and 10, generated using `rand()` for unbiased results.

- **Error-Free Input Validation**:
  - The game ensures valid inputs for both bet amounts and guesses.
  - If the player tries to enter an invalid bet (e.g., more than the available balance or less than 1), the game will prompt them until they make a valid choice.
  - For guesses, it validates that the player picks a number between 1 and 10.

- **Real-Time Feedback**:
  - Immediate feedback on your performance after every round, including win/loss and the updated balance.
  - Special messages when you win a substantial amount, making the game more engaging.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
  - Works on both Windows (using `system("cls")` to clear the screen) and Linux/Mac (using `system("clear")` for clearing the console).

- **Prebuilt `.exe` File**:
  - A compiled `.exe` executable will be provided for those who want to play the game without needing a C compiler or other prerequisites.
  - Note: The `.exe` file is functional but may not be perfect. It’s a quick solution for those who want to experience the gameplay without compiling the code themselves.

## 🛠️ Code Highlights

1. **Random Number Generation**:
   - The game uses the `rand()` function, seeded with `time(0)` to generate random dice numbers between 1 and 10, ensuring fairness in every round.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - The `getValidAmount()` function ensures players only place valid bets, preventing accidental input errors (such as betting more than your available balance).
   - The `getValidGuess()` function ensures players only guess numbers within the allowed range (1-10).

3. **Modular and User-Friendly Design**:
   - Functions like `displayRules()`, `getValidAmount()`, and `getValidGuess()` help make the game flow smooth and easy to follow.
   - The game logic is modular and readable, making it easier to maintain and update.

4. **Interactive Gameplay**:
   - The game dynamically updates your balance after each round and provides clear messages based on whether you win or lose.
   - The game also congratulates you when you hit significant milestones like having a balance greater than 1000 credits.

5. **Cross-Platform Console Clearing**:
   - The game uses `system("cls")` to clear the console for Windows users. For Linux and Mac game uses `system("clear")` instead of `system("cls")` for compatibility.

6. **Prebuilt `.exe` File**:
   - A prebuilt `.exe` executable will be provided for Windows users who don’t want to compile the code themselves. This is a convenient option for quickly testing out the game.
